# The Signal

![Alt text](/assets/images/screenshot.png?raw=true "screenshot")

An attempt at writing a game around version 4 of my raycasting engine, called The Signal. Currently you can reach level 2. It will likely not develop much further :)

## Running it

Use any local webserver, eg:

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:9010
```
